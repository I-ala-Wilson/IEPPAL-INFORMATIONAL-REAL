description: "Hello! I'm Rahul, I'm an aspiring engineer starting on the mechanical engineering path in Imperial College London. I love small puzzles, strategy games, and real-life oriented physics problems. I've spent most of my time after school teaching physics, chemistry, and math to my peers and occasionally playing volleyball."
