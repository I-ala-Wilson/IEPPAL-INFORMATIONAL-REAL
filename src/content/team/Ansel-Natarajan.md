description: "Hey! I'm Ansel, I was born and raised in Singapore and have resided here my whole life. After recently graduating high school and working in EdTech, I joined the Singapore Armed Forces (SAF) as part of my Singaporean National Service (NS). Outside of NS, I love weightlifting, reading non-fiction, and I'm slowly forcing myself to become a runner. My experiences traveling around the world have helped to cultivate a deep passion for education, coaching, and helping others fulfill their potential â€” IEPPAL is an incarnation of my wildest dreams of empowering those in education."
