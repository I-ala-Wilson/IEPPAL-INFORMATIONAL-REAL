description: "Hi! I'm Ian, I'm French and Canadian but currently based in Singapore, where I've spent the majority of my life. Having recently graduated from high school, I am passionate about exploring careers in math, physics, AI, and computer science. I am excited about the opportunities at the intersection of these fields and look forward to contributing to innovative solutions in the tech space. As a student who went through the majority of my secondary education with an IEP, I hope to be able to contribute meaningfully to the field, and support students the way I would have hoped to have been supported when I was in their shoes."
